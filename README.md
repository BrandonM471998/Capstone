# Introduction
In this project I was given the task of comparing Tennessee tornado tracks with traffic and population data. When going through teh dataset I wanted to see if there were any trends in population density, traffic density, and where tornadoes typically strike. Let's find out. For this project I used Python for data analysis and PowerBI for dashboarding.
